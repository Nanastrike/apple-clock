## 🎯 Why I Built This

I often found myself wondering:  
> *"Where did all my time go today?"*  

Apple Clock was born from this question.  
It's my personal tool to:
- stay aware of how I spend time
- develop better focus habits
- make time visible and traceable
- conduct daily/weekly/yearly self-reflection
